An astro-photographer has captured the 'once in a lifetime' moment a meteor exploded before disintegrating into the night sky in Shorpshire.

The scene, which has been recorded very few times on camera, was caught during an Orionid meteor shower.

Orionid meteors occur every Autumn when the Earth is passing through the stream of debris left by Halley's Comet.

Spectacular Orionid meteor shower to pass over Earth
Landscape photographer Nick Jackson had gone to Clun Castle in Shropshire, to shoot the 13th century edifice in front of the night sky to make a "star trail".

But halfway through the shoot, Nick saw the meteor fly across the sky behind the castle.

He said: "I immediately thought, 'I hope that was caught in the frame'. It's very unusual to see a meteor that big. Because I was shooting the star trail, I couldn't check the footage immediately."

When he got home and reviewed his pictures, he realised he had caught the moment.

The 44-year-old said: "It was a sheer stroke of luck that I just happened to be shooting the series of images when it happened. With things like that, you've got to be in the right place at the right time."
