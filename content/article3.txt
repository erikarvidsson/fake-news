Until now, Mike Leigh has been something of a film festival darling. In 1993, the British filmmaker won the Best Director award at Cannes for his black tragicomedy Naked. His next film, 1996’s Secrets & Lies, earned him the festival’s even more illustrious Palme d’Or, and the following year, he was chosen to be on the jury. In 1999, his Gilbert & Sullivan drama Topsy-Turvy was given the coveted centrepiece position at the New York Film Festival, and in 2012, he was the president of the Berlin International Film Festival jury. And yet, despite his decorated past, Leigh’s new film Peterloo ­– his grandest and most expensive project to date – was flat-out rejected by most festival gatekeepers.

“As far as Cannes is concerned, it’s not a red carpet type of a film,” Leigh concedes, playing with the zip of his fleece vest – the same black, Burghaus fleece vest he’s sporting in every other photo of him on the internet, and into which he is nestled in a sort of permanent shrug.

We’re in an office room in Soho. Leigh only just made it in time – his plane back to London from a screening in Edinburgh was several hours delayed – but rather than possessing the harassed demeanour a late flight usually warrants, the 75-year-old seems unruffled. “I mean, we went to Venice [Film Festival] with Peterloo, and Maxine Peake showed up in a nice frock, but she doesn’t actually carry the film, and she wouldn’t claim to. As to why it was rejected by the New York Film Festival… that’s a different matter entirely. In a way, that’s more outrageous.”
