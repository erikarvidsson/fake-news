Friends star David Schwimmer has provided an amusing alibi for himself after police in England released a photo of his lookalike caught stealing from a restaurant.

Schwimmer’s doppelganger caught the actor’s attention after hundreds of people pointed out the resemblance of the crook on the Blackpool police station’s Facebook page - prompting Schwimmer to make it clear he was in New York at the time.

“Officers, I swear it wasn’t me. As you can see, I was in New York,” the actor tweeted - alongside a CCTV video capturing him “stealing” from a grocery store.
